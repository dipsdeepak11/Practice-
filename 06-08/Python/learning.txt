ZIP:::

--->The purpose of zip() is to map the similar index of multiple
 containers so that they can be used just using as single entity.

--->Example::
name=["a","b","c","d"]
marks=[12,23,54,33]

mapped=zip(name,marks)

mapped=set(mapped) ("can we convert to set,list,dict")
print(mapped)

Unzip--- a,b=zip(*mapped)--(variable are based no. of
                             element in zip)

****If the 2 iterator to be zipped,have diff. no, od element,than
the zip contain the no .of element=iterator having smaller no.
of element.

***DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZIP() AND IZIP()::
zip return actual list and izip return an izip object, so zip
support all the funcctioanlity of list.
on the other hand, izip saves memeory.


ENUMERATE:::

This add a counter to a iterable and returnit in the form of 
enumerate object.

RETURN VALUE IS OF ENUMERATE OBJECT.

SYNTAX= enumerate(iterable,start=0)

Example 1::
l1=["a","b","c"]
res=enumerate(l1)
res2=enumerate(l1,,2)
print list(res) (**converating it to the list) 

OUTPUT===  0 a 1 b 2 c
           2 a 3 b 4 c
           [(0,a),(1,b),(2,c)]

Example 2::
l1=["eat","sleep","repeat"]

for ele in enumerate(l1):
     print ele    ----- (0,eat)

for count,ele in enumerate(l1):
     print count,ele     ------ 0 , eat


##PROGRAM TO USE ZIP AND ENUMERATE TOGETHER::

list_a=["a1","a2","a3"]
list_b=["b1","b2","b3"]

for i, (a,b) in enumerate(zip(list_a,list_b)):
          print i, a, b

OUTPUT===
0  a1  b1
1  a2  b2
2  a3  b3
