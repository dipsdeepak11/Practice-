-->What are permissions and How do they work::

a file's permissions determine which users 
may access that file, and what type of access they have to it.

-->Three type of Users:
1.USER(owns the file)  
2.Group(users inside file defined ownership grp.) 
3.Other(any other)

-->Type of file access:
R  W  E

--->running umask ,shows us the default umask value -002

--->umask basically used to set permission for a file or directory
before the file is made.

--->FIle creation mask using numerial
READ - 4
WRITE - 2
EXECUTE - 1

-->    DEFAULT         UMASK-DEFAULT     FINAL
  
file--   666                 002           664

dir---   777                 002           775

--->So,default file permission after default umask apply
rw-rw-r--


--->CHANGE UMASK::
1.umask 022
2.umask a+r(give all the permission to read)
