Touch is basically used to change the timestamp.It can also be used
to create file

A timestamp is information associated with a file that identifies 
an important time in the file's history.

3 type of time:
  -access time
  -modification time
  -change time

The only required argument to touch is a file name.

If no options is provided, the touch will change all the 3 type of
time to the system time.

OPTIONS::
-a = change the access time only
-c = do not create file
-d = take a human readable data string(Dec 1,2017 00:00:00)
-h = change the time of symbolic link not the referenced file.
-m =set the modificaion time only
-t = use the numeric timestamp instead of current time
(CCYYMMDDHHMM.SS)

--> touch -cr a.txt b.txt == change the c and m time of b to 
match time of a

Checking file times with stat::
   we can check the file time using stat command
--- if file not exist, first make the file using touch and 
then stat the file.
